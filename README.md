The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software systems efficiently and effectively. It provides a systematic approach to building software that meets user requirements while maintaining quality and meeting deadlines. SDLC typically includes several key phases: planning, requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase serves a specific purpose, ensuring that the project stays on track, within budget, and delivers a functional, high-quality product.

Various SDLC models exist, such as Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model, each tailored to different types of projects and team workflows. For example, Agile promotes iterative development and continuous feedback, making it ideal for projects with evolving requirements. On the other hand, Waterfall follows a linear approach, suitable for projects with well-defined requirements from the start. Choosing the right SDLC model helps teams reduce risks, improve collaboration, and deliver software that aligns with both user expectations and business goals.
